                           <p>Swami Vivekananda was a famous Indian Hindu monk who later became a disciple of the saint Ramakrishna in the 19 th century. He was the founder of the Ramakrishna Math and the Ramakrishna Mission.
                               Swami Vivekananda mentioned communalism, religious bigotry, and violence in his address.
                                He said that if these evils had not happened, the world would have been a better place than today.</p>
                      <li><h2>Meeting with Ramkrishna Paramhansa and Harmonization of Indian Culture</h2></li>
                          <p>Swami Vivekananda met Ramkrishna Paramhansa for the first time when the latter visited his friend’s residence in Kolkata. 
                              Conscious of the supernatural powers of Swami Vivekananda called him to Dakshineshwar. 
                              He had a deep insight that Swamiji’s birth was a boon to mankind for the upliftment of the universe.
                               Fulfillment of his spiritual inquisitiveness made he finally acknowledge Ramkrishna Paramhansa in the figure of his “Guru”. He was moved from darkness to illumination by his “Guru”. As his deep gratitude and reverence for his Guru made him travel all the four directions for the diffusion of his Guru’s teachings.

                            Swamiji won the hearts of everyone by his incredible speech at Chicago by addressing the audience as “Sisters and Brothers of America”
                            
                            Vivekananda quoted these words” I am proud to belong to a religion which has taught the world both tolerance and universal acceptance. We believe not only in universal tolerance but we accept all religions as true.” Thus, he set forward the worth of Indian religion exhibiting the values of universal acceptance, oneness, and harmony despite multiplicity in cultures.
                            
                            Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose once said,” Swamiji harmonized the East and the West, religion, and science, past and the present and that is why he is great.” He played a prominent role in ending India’s cultural remoteness from the rest of the world.
                            
                            A figure of highest ideals and great thoughts, Swamiji was an inspiration for the Youth of India.  Through his teachings he wanted to fill the young brains with the powers of self-realization, character formation, to recognize inner strengths, service to others, an optimistic outlook, tireless efforts and a lot more.</p>

                            His famous quotations include, “Arise, awake and stop not till the goal is reached.” He also added that anything making a child physically, intellectually and spiritually weak must be rejected as a poison. He also emphasized on an education that leads to character formation.
                            
                            His establishment of “Ramkrishna Math” and “Ramkrishna Mission” was a sign of “Guru Bhakti”, his sacrifice, austerity, and service of the poor and the downtrodden people of India. He was also a founder of Belur Math.
                            
                            He spread the message of divinity and the true aims of scriptures. This great patriotic monk of the Mother Earth took his last breath on 4th July 1902 at Belur Math.
                            
                            Conclusion
                            Swamiji carried the messages of the rich and varied heritage of Indian culture and Hinduism, non-duality, selfless love, and service towards the nation. His mesmerizing personality with the highest virtues illuminated the young minds. His teachings aroused the realization of the power of the soul in them.
                            
                            Thus, we celebrate his “Avtaran Divas” 12th January, as the National Youth Day with great zeal and enthusiasm.</p>
